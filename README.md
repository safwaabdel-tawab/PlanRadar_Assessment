# PlanRadar_Assessment

### What to expect from the app?
What will you see?
At the start you will see the unity logo.
Then the loading screen followed by another scene, which has the building model and a reset button on the top left, and the frame per second on the top right

### How will you interact with the app?
With 2 fingers touch (pinch): you will be able to zoom in and out to/from the center of the building.
With one finger touch (swiping): you will be able to rotate the building.
When the “Reset” button is clicked: the whole building will lerp to its initial view in a smooth way.



Note: This project was tested on editor and on android device only.
